        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I decided to study computer science because of my love of problem solving and the flexibility and variety of problems that can be solved with computer science. 
            I love how vast the field is and the fact that there are so many areas to explore. Everytime I discover a new field in computer science I always get very curious and want to 
            learn more about it. Outside of programming at my school and during my internship, I enjoy travelling and visiting new places, I especially enjoy trying new food.
